## Use Case of AI Computer Vision to detect product information for grocery deliveries
This repo showcases the use case of object detection technology to identify products (crop pictures) and detect product information using Google Lens APIs.
On top of that logic, I added additional grocery retail APIs (Walmart, Target, and Kroger) to detect the most accurate and helpful information for grocery delivery shoppers.
This flow was built as POC to identify alternative products from pictures for customers will be a better communication method for shoppers when the requested items are out of stock.
